This is a project where I tried Spring Cloud Function as a Generic Implementation to Lambda Functions. 
This demo repo contains 3 small implementations and 3 ways to implement a lambda function. 
1. A Spring bean based implementation.
2. An implementation where we are implementing java's Function's interface to override apply method and that will provide implementation to our Lambda Function. 
3. A Spring based implementation which is more practical in nature. This example works with Service, Component. 

In order to run them, you got to setup 3 separate Lambda Functions. You can still use the same repo.
